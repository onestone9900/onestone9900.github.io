# 7. Core Features
This section dives into the details of Spring Boot. Here you can learn about the key features that you may want to use and customize. If you have not already done so, you might want to read the "Getting Started" and "Developing with Spring Boot" sections, so that you have a good grounding of the basics.

## 7.1. SpringApplication
The SpringApplication class provides a convenient way to bootstrap a Spring application that is started from a main() method. In many situations, you can delegate to the static SpringApplication.run method, as shown in the following example:

`자바`
```java
    import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class MyApplication {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
        } 
    }
```

`코틀린`
```kotlin
    import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
    import org.springframework.boot.runApplication

    @SpringBootApplication
    class MyApplication
    
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        runApplication<MyApplication>(*args)
    }
```

When your application starts, you should see something similar to the following output:
```

```

By default, INFO logging messages are shown, including some relevant startup details, such as the user that launched the application. If you need a log level other than INFO, you can set it, as described in Log Levels. The application version is determined using the implementation version from the main application class’s package. Startup information logging can be turned off by setting spring.main.log-startup-info to false. This will also turn off logging of the application’s active profiles.
