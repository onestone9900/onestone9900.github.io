Try the How-to documents. They provide solutions to the most common questions.

Learn the Spring basics. Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects. Check the spring.io web-site for a wealth of reference documentation. If you are starting out with Spring, try one of the guides.

Ask a question. We monitor stackoverflow.com for questions tagged with spring-boot.

Report bugs with Spring Boot at github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues.

All of Spring Boot is open source, including the documentation. If you find problems with the docs or if you want to improve them, please get involved.
